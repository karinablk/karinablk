## 🧠 About Me

I’m a career switcher currently transitioning into data and machine learning, following 16+ years of experience in strategic roles across media and e-commerce.  
I’ve completed a data science bootcamp, built several end-to-end projects, and I’m passionate about using data to solve meaningful business problems.  
Curious by nature, I enjoy connecting business logic with data insights and continue to grow through hands-on learning.

Each of them involved end-to-end development — from data acquisition to analysis and model evaluation.
